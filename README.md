My experiments with rendering simple model within QtQuick capabilities. No Qt3D stuff was used.

I used code snippets from  [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) for .obj file parsing. The model itself was also taken from him.

Code snippets for my QML implementation of trackball was taken from [Robert Eisele](https://www.xarg.org/2021/07/trackball-rotation-using-quaternions/).
